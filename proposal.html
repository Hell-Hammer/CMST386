<h2 style="text-align:center">Jair Daza's Proposal</h2>

        <h2>Development Process and Engagement:</h2>
        <blockquote><p>For my website proposal in this session, I am going to focus on building a webpage that can apply to any local music band. I will be building this website for a local band from Elizabeth, New Jersey.  </p></blockquote>

        <h2> Testing:</h2>
        <blockquote><p>I will be using Atom as my software to create the HTML code and CSS. This allows me to see what I create before I upload anything onto Github. </p></blockquote>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <blockquote><p>The local band is looking into taking advantage of Github’s free service as the band can upload their material for the world wide web. Since it is the band’s first website, their purpose is to deliver their material to the world wide web as smooth as possible. This would go directly to all of their fans who listen to that type of genre of music.
        </p></blockquote>

        <h2>Growth Potential and Maintenance:</h2>
        <blockquote><p> As the band expose themselves into the world, their fans will grow, which will make the website grow. It will have to constantly get updated with merchandize and current news for the fans.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Organization:</h2>
        <blockquote><p> I plan on having 10 subtopics on my website that are created around the band’s needs. My 10 subtopics are: Home, Discography, Biography, Forums/Blog, Media/Images/Videos, Equipment/Gear, Store, Tours, Links, and Miscellaneous. </p></blockquote>

        <h2>Web Hosting:</h2>
        <blockquote><p> For this website, I will be using Github. Github allows me to easily upload my work on the world wide web. I will also be using a storefront for the store/merchandize subtopic.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Marketing:</h2>
        <blockquote><p> I will market this website by making the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) elements related to the genre of music, the band’s name, the member’s name, and record label. </p></blockquote>
