  <h2>What do you want to learn in this course? </h2>

    <p>From this course, I am looking to become proficient in HTML and in CSS. I am looking forward to putting together a working website which will help me in my career in the future. I am hoping to learn more about how to make my website look professional by adding neat features such as video and audio.
